## Copycat
This project is a pattern matching web application. The application will display a pattern, and then ask you to repeat it back. 
As you progress through the game, the patterns get longer.

## Motivation

I wanted to implement this project as a way to create a game that provides a cool user experience, while also giving me
the ability to leverage some tools I have been learning like Redux.
